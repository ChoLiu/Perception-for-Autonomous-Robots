# Perception-for-Autonomous-Robots
ENPM6733Perception for Autonomous RobotsImage Processing and Computer Vision techniques for Mobile Robots is taught. Three topics are covered: Image Processing (Image Enhancement, Filtering, Advanced Edge and Texture ), 3D Vision (3D Geometry from Multiple view geometry, Motion Processing and Stereo) and an Introduction to Image Segmentation and Object Recognition. Students are introduced to a number of existing software toolboxes from Vision and Robotics, and will implement a number of smaller projects in OpenCV.RoboticsCore

### 1. Trafic Signs Detection
In this project we aim to do Traffic Sign Recognition. You will perform the two steps of detection and recognition.
You can use existing OpenCV code (HOG feature detector, MSER feature detector, SVM routines) to create
the complete pipeline. The challenge will be in tuning the system to detect well.
The link of image data set is in the ENPM673_P6.pdf file. The project guideline is also in this file.
